                <h2>Ethical Implications of an Artificially Intelligent Government</h2>

                <p>As if effective government wasn’t hard enough to figure out, let’s see if we can throw in big data and have it sort itself out. For my ethics essay, I research and write about the implications of Artificial Intelligence for Government and public policy. “As a society, we might accept less bias in a system of government that uses AI. In this way, a data-driven government might actually be more fair, transparent and responsive than the human face of officialdom.” (Nature Editorial, 2019) It is important for policymakers to harness data to deliver public services that are responsive, efficient and fair. Agent computing models, in combination with large-scale data, can capture the complexities of the real world more ably than before and are beginning to be used for testing policies and interventions. However, the modern day issue is that the general public has become polarized by the Government and big corporations’ level of data collection and citizen monitoring. Optimists may welcome the usage of Artificial Intelligence, and believe there can be positive applications of it used throughout government; but skeptics of AI in government worry about the invasion of individual privacy or have a general mistrust of placing more power to government. The foundations of Big Data in the government can be traced back to the formation of the U.S. Census Bureau in 1880. The creation of the United States’ National Security Agency (NSA) in 1952 originally decrypted messages intercepted during the Cold War. (Foote, 2017) After the 9/11/01 Terror Attacks, the Patriot Act would forever change precedence over the extent of how the government can control data. It wasn’t until June of 2013 when Edward Snowden leaked NSA documents and project details that would provoke the entire western world on discussing limitations of government surveillance and intelligence agency overreach. Though we can theorize that Artificial Intelligence and other Big Data projects can improve systems, provide us more security, or create fair and effective policies— it is evident that stakeholders between the adoption of AI into government remain divided on that sentiment. 
The two sets of stakeholders are proponents of AI being implemented in Government systems, and the other stakeholder is composed of those who might feel anxiety, fear, caution, or even disdain about AI further giving government the power and means to possibly infringe on individual rights.  On one side of the coin, proponents of AI in government are optimists, data-driven, and typically progressive in ideals. What’s important for these stakeholders is process improvements in government systems through means of  innovation and new technologies, but certainly within ethical bounds. Optimists would suggest that AI would help tremendously with things such as better resource/budget allocation, smarter and more effective policy making, and possibly even for detecting corruption. According to a recent publication from the Boston Consulting Group, a proponent of AI in government, they claim that Artificial Intelligence would generate benefits or value for the public-sector or government by smarter policymaking, reimagining service delivery, and more efficient operations (Abillama et al., 2021). As for the values of the second stakeholders opposed to AI being implemented in governments, they can be characterized as cautious, fearful, doubtful, pessimistic, or even disdainful. For these stakeholders, it is important that the powers of government are limited, and that there is no vehicle the government can use to invade or infringe on the privacy of citizens. The issue is that opposers of AI in Government fear about privacy violation, bias in algorithms regarding law-enforcement, “runaway reaction” of AI self-improvement cycles, and many other fearful concerns about the unknown future of Artificial Intelligence. “As artificial intelligence evolves, it magnifies the ability to use personal information in ways that can intrude on privacy interests by raising analysis of personal information to new levels of power and speed.” (Kerry, 2020) For the stakeholders who are skeptical of AI in government and argue upon the main premise of individual privacy, I would say that this is a claim of cause or rather a purpose of individuality. 
The thing about implementing Artificial Intelligence into government is that we are trying to apply Computer Science solutions into Social Science problems. I believe the most helpful question to ask for both stakeholders will be “Will implementation of Artificial Intelligence in certain aspects of government truly pose an individualistic privacy threat?” Also another good question is “If there is a certain level of transparency on the government’s usage of Artificial Intelligence, and ways for the individual to control my own visibility, is that an acceptable bounds for AI usage?” From the Forbes article “should really fear AI?”general anxiety about AI include the fear that it is a Job Killer, that AI in the wrong hands can be major security threats to infrastructure, and also the fear of Super Intelligence (Schmelzer, 2019). 
For arguing and presenting the side that's in favor of using AI in government, Stakeholder 1 will likely contend a Utilitarian approach in terms of ethical framework decision. This framework is the most common approach to making ethical decisions, especially on decisions with consequences that concern large groups of people. Originally developed by Jeremy Bentham, and continued by John Stuart Mill, Henry Sidgwick, R.M. Hare, and Peter Singer, the ethical theory endorses actions that maximize happiness and well-being for all affected individuals. Essentially, the Utilitarian approach seeks to produce the greatest balance of good over harm, focusing on the good that AI can bring into policy making while addressing the ethical constraints, controls, and failsafes that need to be implemented to mitigate any harm AI might cause. AI Proponents believe this course of action in government is correct because they claim that Artificial Intelligence can improve process efficiency, eliminate wasteful spending, prevent corruption, and overall have a more effective government. According to these stakeholders, adopting AI can be crucial to guiding informed decision making on policies and resource allocation. By implementing AI into government, this stakeholder group gains a huge responsibility in ethically upholding good faith usage of AI, otherwise they would lose power to AI naysayers who clamour for individual rights and privacy regardless of public general welfare. As for these naysayers however, the Rights Based Approach or a Kantian duty-based ethics are likely the adopted ethics framework for the second stakeholder. Duty based ethics would argue that the belief that all humans have a right to respect and dignity. The framework was developed by Immanuel Kant, a German philosopher of the Enlightenment era. The tenets of this framework argue that our stakeholder’s individual right to privacy may be encroached by AI frameworks dictating socio-economic, law enforcement, or other types of policies determined by the biases of the AI algorithm writers. AI in government opposition often believe that the government should have limited powers and should not adopt technologies that grossly collect data and infringes on the privacy of its citizens. The opposition stakeholder slates to gain more anonymity and/or autonomy from the government. Many of these stakeholders believe they don’t need help from the government, so actively giving more government power in technology is not beneficial to them whatsoever. Thus, this stakeholder could stand to lose their sense of privacy or be burdened by other “big government” actions.
I find validity in the concerns and ideations of both stakeholders. I believe there could certainly be a middle ground achieved between the implementation of AI in government that can still be within respectable boundaries of privacy constraints, and that AI can be used in ways to improve the government which in theory should save the government money on spending. I align with the first stakeholder, the proponent, in that I believe government can certainly use AI to improve processes and overall by more efficient and effective, but I also sympathize with the second stakeholder, the opposition, and their concern for government overreach, and would actively be making it my main agenda to ensure that ethical considerations are central in the decision making of implementing AI into government systems. According to the report revealed at the World Government Summit in 2019, having ethics at the heart of AI is necessary for shaping the governance guidelines for AI (Hashimi, 2017). That is why I believe a rogerian argument could be made, or that a middleground can be found between the proponents and opponents of AI to be implemented in government. So as long as we adopt a global ethical standard for government AI, both stakeholders can be satisfied that AI will be implemented into governments for progressive purposes but have to be within bounds of privacy limitations and actively strayed away from overreaching and abusing.
